## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to create a dynamic website that shows information about UFO sightings. The website has filters that the user can use to sift through the data. They can sort by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources:

**Data Source:** [UFO Data](https://github.com/matthubb17/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)

**Challenge File (index.html):** [Webpage](https://github.com/matthubb17/UFOs/blob/main/index.html)

**Software:** HTML, JavaScript, VS Code, Bootstrap

## Results:

- Below is a screenshot of the main website that was created.

- When looking at the filters on the left of the webpage a user can input data in any of the filters. Once the data is input the table will be updated to show data based on the criteria that was input in the filters. Below you can see an example of filtering to a specific date.

## Summary:

- One drawback of this current website design is that all of the data is in lower case lettering. This becomes an issue if a user of the website is searching for a city and uses a capital letter. In this example no results would currently show up.

- The first recommendation that I would make would be to make a reset filter button below the filters. This will make using the filters a bit easier.
- The second recommendation that I would make would be to make filtering easier by including a drop down list for each filter so that the user has a better idea of what cities, states, ect. are available within the data rather than getting no results when searching.
